&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong. But we think you&amp;rsquo;re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see usâ€”in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case a princess and a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088847/quotes?item=qt0475594&#34; title=&#34;The Breakfast Club&#34;&gt;the Breakfast Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to all my appraisers ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#YearEnd&lt;/p&gt;
