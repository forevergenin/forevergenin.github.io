&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong. But we think you&amp;rsquo;re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see usâ€”in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case a princess and a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088847/quotes?item=qt0475594&#34; title=&#34;The Breakfast Club&#34;&gt;the Breakfast Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to all my appraisers ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#YearEnd&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, after much deliberation I have decided to spend some time on maintaining a personal blog (more about this &lt;em&gt;decision&lt;/em&gt; later). Now the question is what should be my first post? Much like most of the decisions I have made in my life I left this one as well to randomness and I stumbled upon this &lt;a href=&#34;http://kotaku.com/the-naruto-manga-ends-next-month-1642809700&#34; title=&#34;Naruto Manga Ends&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://kotaku.com&#34; title=&#34;Kotaku.com&#34;&gt;Kotaku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it was my first manga, the truth is I was not worried much about the end. In fact I felt a sense of relief considering the recent decline in the quality of Naruto storyline. Good or bad, all things must come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
