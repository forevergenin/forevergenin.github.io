      <description>We will see how to generate a rootfs tarball for redhat based system. Since we are targetting redhat based system, I am going to use debian based system (Ubuntu 17.10 64-bit - latest at the time of writing this post) as my host. We will generate rootfs tarball for CentOS 7 64-bit.
The below mentioned steps are validated on Ubuntu 17.10 desktop installation.
Lets get started As usual the first step, install the required dependecy packages which in our case is yum.
sudo apt install yum Second, will prepare the required directory structure. In our example ~/work will be our working directory and we will install the CentOS 7 roofs in inside of work in a directory named centos7.</description>

      <description>The aim this time is to setup a base rootfs for Ubuntu/Debian distro which can be used for setting up a chroot jail or to create a docker container base image. This blog is based on a earlier blog which I have written but forgot to publish around June, 2012.
The below mentioned steps are validated on Fedora 25 Workstation installation.
For setting up a debian based rootfs we need a tool called debootstrap. It&amp;rsquo;s available as part of EPEL repository for Fedora and other Redhat based distros. Make sure to always install the latest version of debootstrap.
sudo dnf install debootstrap To setup a base rootfs you need to decide on the version of debian distro (wheezy, jessie, buster), the target architecture (i386 or amd64) and what kind of variant you want to setup.</description>
