      <description>Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong. But we think you&amp;rsquo;re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see usâ€”in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case a princess and a criminal.
Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.</description>
