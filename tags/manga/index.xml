      <description>Last updated on August 18, 2017 I have decided to temporarily stop reading manga. I made a promise couple of years back when Bleach ends I will stop reading manga altogether. Still one chapter is pending for end of Bleach. I hope this will be the last update on this page. ;-)
This is my official track list for all the Mangas/Manhwas I have completed or currently reading.
Currently Reading:  One Piece 872 Tales of Demons and Gods 108 Fairy Tail 543 Noblesse 467 Spirit Blade Mountain 137 D.</description>

      <description>Finally, after much deliberation I have decided to spend some time on maintaining a personal blog (more about this decision later). Now the question is what should be my first post? Much like most of the decisions I have made in my life I left this one as well to randomness and I stumbled upon this article at Kotaku.
Though it was my first manga, the truth is I was not worried much about the end.</description>
