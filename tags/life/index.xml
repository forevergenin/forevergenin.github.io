      <description>I always wondered what leads to those lifelong friendships ?
The answer seems to lie in memories.
The foundation for any good friendship/relationship is built by memories shared between people. The memory can be a fun one or a boring one, but spending time and making that memory is vital.
A boring memory is better than no memory at all. Those shared memories create the bond and more memories leads to a stronger bond.
The only catch is once you make them you can&amp;rsquo;t undo them. But that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the problem because, a boring memory is always better than no memory at all.</description>
