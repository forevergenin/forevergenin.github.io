      <description>Finally, after much deliberation I have decided to spend some time on maintaining a personal blog (more about this decision later). Now the question is what should be my first post? Much like most of the decisions I have made in my life I left this one as well to randomness and I stumbled upon this article at Kotaku.
Though it was my first manga, the truth is I was not worried much about the end.</description>
