Finally, after much deliberation I have decided to spend some time on maintaining a personal blog (more about this *decision* later). Now the question is what should be my first post? Much like most of the decisions I have made in my life I left this one as well to randomness and I stumbled upon this [article][article] on [Kotaku.com][kotaku].

Though it was my first manga, the truth is I was not worried much about the end. In fact I felt a sense of relief considering the recent decline in the quality of Naruto storyline. Good or bad, all things must come to an end.
