      <description> This check-list tries to document the obvious, to reduce the time spent fixing toolchain related errors while cross compiling.
 Export the toolchain location to the PATH environment variable Set proper --sysroot for CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS Set proper PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR, PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR for pkg-config tool. This is important for build scripts which use pkg-config to determine the proper build flags.  Note: Use pkg-config = 0.26 . There is bug with previous versions of pkg-config which ignores the PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR value  A sample configuration  Note : Need to update the post on how to cross compile packages which use autoconf tools  </description>

      <description>Until few years back setting up Java development environment based on Sun/Oracle JDK was fairly a simple task. Since most of the linux distributions included Oracle/Sun JDK as part of their default package repository (here read as Canonical&amp;rsquo;s partner repository ;-)) it was as easy as installing any other core linux pacakge. But in recent times due to license restrictions Oracle JDK is not included in any of the linux distribution repositories by default.</description>

      <description>Last updated on August 18, 2017 I have decided to temporarily stop reading manga. I made a promise couple of years back when Bleach ends I will stop reading manga altogether. Still one chapter is pending for end of Bleach. I hope this will be the last update on this page. ;-)
This is my official track list for all the Mangas/Manhwas I have completed or currently reading.
Currently Reading:  One Piece 872 Tales of Demons and Gods 108 Fairy Tail 543 Noblesse 467 Spirit Blade Mountain 137 D.</description>

      <description>Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong. But we think you&amp;rsquo;re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see usâ€”in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case a princess and a criminal.</description>

      <description>Finally, after much deliberation I have decided to spend some time on maintaining a personal blog (more about this decision later). Now the question is what should be my first post? Much like most of the decisions I have made in my life I left this one as well to randomness and I stumbled upon this article at Kotaku.
Though it was my first manga, the truth is I was not worried much about the end.</description>
