      <description>We will see how to generate a rootfs tarball for redhat based system. Since we are targetting redhat based system, I am going to use debian based system (Ubuntu 17.10 64-bit - latest at the time of writing this post) as my host. We will generate rootfs tarball for CentOS 7 64-bit.å
 The below mentioned steps are validated on Ubuntu 17.10 desktop installation.  
Lets get started As usual the first step, install the required dependecy packages which in our case is yum.</description>

      <description>The aim this time is to setup a base rootfs for Ubuntu/Debian distro which can be used for setting up a chroot jail or to create a docker container base image. This blog is based on a earlier blog which I have written but forgot to publish around June, 2012.
 The below mentioned steps are validated on Fedora 25 Workstation installation.  
For setting up a debian based rootfs we need a tool called debootstrap.</description>

      <title>Forwarding DNS server on Ubuntu 16.04</title>

      <description>Goal We are looking to setup up a minimal forwarding DNS server on Ubuntu 16.04. After that we will see how to use nsupdate and dig to verify our configuration.
Prerequisites  A VM running Ubuntu 16.04 with BIND installed  You need root access for the VM  External DNS server information  We are going to use google&amp;rsquo;s DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) as our external servers. In case a query can&amp;rsquo;t be resolved by our DNS server it will forward the request to the external server.</description>

      <description> This check-list tries to document the obvious, to reduce the time spent fixing toolchain related errors while cross compiling.
 Export the toolchain location to the PATH environment variable Set proper --sysroot for CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS Set proper PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR, PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR for pkg-config tool. This is important for build scripts which use pkg-config to determine the proper build flags.  Note: Use pkg-config = 0.26 . There is bug with previous versions of pkg-config which ignores the PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR value  A sample configuration  Note : Need to update the post on how to cross compile packages which use autoconf tools  </description>

      <description>Until few years back setting up Java development environment based on Sun/Oracle JDK was fairly a simple task. Since most of the linux distributions included Oracle/Sun JDK as part of their default package repository (here read as Canonical&amp;rsquo;s partner repository ;-)) it was as easy as installing any other core linux pacakge. But in recent times due to license restrictions Oracle JDK is not included in any of the linux distribution repositories by default.</description>

      <description>Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong. But we think you&amp;rsquo;re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us—in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case a princess and a criminal.</description>

      <description>Finally, after much deliberation I have decided to spend some time on maintaining a personal blog (more about this decision later). Now the question is what should be my first post? Much like most of the decisions I have made in my life I left this one as well to randomness and I stumbled upon this article at Kotaku.
Though it was my first manga, the truth is I was not worried much about the end.</description>
